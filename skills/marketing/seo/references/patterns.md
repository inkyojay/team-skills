  #### **Name**
Skyscraper Technique
  #### **Description**
Find top-ranking content, create better version, earn their links
  #### **When**
Building backlinks in competitive topic areas
  #### **Example**
    Step 1: Find high-ranking content with many backlinks (Ahrefs)
    Example: "Email marketing guide" has 500 backlinks
    
    Step 2: Create superior version (longer, updated, better examples, video)
    Your guide: 10k words vs their 3k, 2025 data, interactive examples
    
    Step 3: Reach out to sites linking to old version
    "Hey, saw you linked to [old guide]. We created [new guide] with updated
    2025 tactics and video tutorials. Might be valuable for your readers."
    
    Conversion rate: 5-10% of outreach typically links back.

  #### **Name**
Internal Linking Hierarchy
  #### **Description**
Use internal links to distribute authority and guide crawlers
  #### **When**
You have multiple pages competing for same keywords or orphaned content
  #### **Example**
    Structure:
    Homepage → Category pages → Subcategory pages → Individual articles
    
    Link from high-authority pages (homepage) to important pages.
    Link from new content to older pillar content.
    Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here").
    
    Example:
    Blog post on "email subject lines" links to pillar "email marketing guide"
    with anchor text "comprehensive email marketing strategies"
    
    Tools: Screaming Frog to find orphaned pages (no internal links)

  #### **Name**
Featured Snippet Optimization
  #### **Description**
Structure content to capture position zero in search results
  #### **When**
Targeting informational queries with high search volume
  #### **Example**
    Query type → Format:
    - "How to X" → Numbered steps (H2 for each step)
    - "What is X" → Short paragraph definition (40-60 words)
    - "Best X" → Bulleted list with brief explanations
    - "X vs Y" → Comparison table
    
    Example for "what is SEO":
    <p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the practice of improving
    website visibility in organic search results by optimizing content,
    technical structure, and backlink profile to match search engine
    ranking algorithms and user intent.</p>
    
    Keep under 60 words. Use simple language. Answer directly.

  #### **Name**
Search Intent Clustering
  #### **Description**
Group keywords by intent to create right content format
  #### **When**
Planning content strategy with keyword research
  #### **Example**
    Keyword: "project management"
    
    Informational: "what is project management" → Guide/definition
    Navigational: "asana project management" → Product page
    Commercial: "best project management software" → Comparison post
    Transactional: "buy project management software" → Pricing page
    
    Don't create blog post for transactional intent. Match format to intent.

  #### **Name**
E-E-A-T Optimization
  #### **Description**
Demonstrate Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness
  #### **When**
Creating content in YMYL (Your Money Your Life) categories
  #### **Example**
    Experience: Author bylines with credentials, case studies, real examples
    Expertise: Detailed technical content, original research, citations
    Authoritativeness: Backlinks from authoritative sites, media mentions
    Trustworthiness: HTTPS, clear privacy policy, contact info, reviews
    
    For medical content: Author must be MD. For legal: JD. For finance: CFP.
    Google heavily weights credentials in YMYL topics.

  #### **Name**
Content Refresh Strategy
  #### **Description**
Update existing content to maintain and improve rankings
  #### **When**
You have aged content that's declining in rankings
  #### **Example**
    Quarterly audit:
    1. Export pages losing traffic (Search Console)
    2. Check if ranking dropped or search volume declined
    3. For dropped rankings: Update content
    
    Updates:
    - Refresh statistics and data (current year)
    - Add new sections for recent developments
    - Improve depth and examples
    - Update title to current year "Best X (2025)"
    - Add new internal links to recent content
    
    Re-publish with updated date. Often regains rankings within 2-4 weeks.

  #### **Name**
Topical Authority Building
  #### **Description**
Dominate a specific topic cluster to signal expertise to Google
  #### **When**
Entering competitive space or establishing expertise in niche
  #### **Example**
    Instead of one post on "email marketing", own the entire topic:
    
    Pillar page (comprehensive): "Complete Guide to Email Marketing"
    Supporting clusters:
    - "Email List Building" (15 posts)
      → List magnets, signup forms, landing pages, growth tactics
    - "Email Copywriting" (12 posts)
      → Subject lines, body copy, CTAs, personalization
    - "Email Deliverability" (10 posts)
      → Spam filters, authentication, inbox placement
    - "Email Analytics" (8 posts)
      → Open rates, click rates, conversion tracking
    
    Link all supporting content to pillar. Link pillar from high-authority pages.
    
    Why it works: Google uses topic modeling. If you comprehensively cover
    a topic with interconnected content, you signal expertise. Competitors
    with scattered content can't compete.
    
    Timeline: 6-12 months to see topical authority impact.

  #### **Name**
Zero-Click Optimization
  #### **Description**
Capture featured snippets and knowledge panels even when users don't click
  #### **When**
High-volume informational queries where Google shows direct answers
  #### **Example**
    Problem: 50% of searches end without a click. Optimize for zero-click anyway.
    
    Benefits:
    - Brand visibility at position zero
    - Authority signal (if Google trusts your answer)
    - Captures voice search results
    - Drives clicks for related queries
    
    Tactics:
    1. Short, direct answers in first paragraph (40-60 words)
    2. Structured data (FAQ, HowTo schema)
    3. Tables for comparison queries
    4. Lists for "best X" queries
    5. Step-by-step for "how to X" queries
    
    Example: "What is CTR in SEO?"
    Answer format: "CTR (Click-Through Rate) in SEO is the percentage of
    users who click your search result after seeing it. Formula: (Clicks ÷
    Impressions) × 100. Average organic CTR is 3-5% depending on position."
    
    Then expand with examples, data, tactics below the snippet.

  #### **Name**
Programmatic SEO at Scale
  #### **Description**
Generate hundreds of valuable pages from structured data
  #### **When**
You have structured data that can create unique, valuable pages
  #### **Example**
    Use cases:
    - Location pages: "Plumber in [city]"
    - Comparison pages: "[Product A] vs [Product B]"
    - Category pages: "[Category] in [location]"
    - Data pages: "[Salary] for [job] in [city]"
    
    Requirements:
    1. Unique, valuable content per page (not thin templates)
    2. Dynamic data insertion (salary data, reviews, local info)
    3. Proper canonicals and indexing strategy
    4. Internal linking between generated pages
    
    Example: Job board with salary data
    Template: "Software Engineer Salary in San Francisco"
    Data sources:
    - BLS salary data
    - Cost of living index
    - Local job postings
    - Company reviews
    
    Page content:
    - Average salary (unique data)
    - Salary range by experience
    - Cost of living context
    - Top hiring companies
    - Related job titles
    
    Avoid: Pure templates with no unique value. Google penalizes thin programmatic content.
    
    Done right: 500 valuable pages in weeks vs. years of manual writing.

  #### **Name**
AI Content + Human Expertise Hybrid
  #### **Description**
Use AI for scale, human expertise for differentiation
  #### **When**
Need content volume but can't sacrifice quality or E-E-A-T
  #### **Example**
    AI can't:
    - Share firsthand experience
    - Provide contrarian insights
    - Build trust and authority
    - Understand nuanced user intent
    
    AI can:
    - Generate first drafts quickly
    - Research and summarize data
    - Create structured outlines
    - Optimize for keywords
    
    Hybrid workflow:
    1. AI generates outline + first draft (60% done)
    2. Human expert adds:
       - Personal experience and examples
       - Contrarian or nuanced takes
       - Updated data and research
       - Expert credibility signals
    3. AI optimizes:
       - Keyword placement
       - Readability
       - Meta descriptions
    4. Human final review for quality
    
    Example: AI drafts "How to improve email open rates"
    Human adds:
    - "I tested 247 subject lines and here's what actually worked"
    - Specific examples from campaigns
    - Counterintuitive finding: "Personalization decreased opens by 12% for B2B"
    - Screenshots of real results
    
    Result: Scale of AI, trust of human expertise. Best of both.
    
    Disclosure: Be transparent about AI usage where appropriate.
