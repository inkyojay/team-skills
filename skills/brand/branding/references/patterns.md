## Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Systematic Brand Architecture
  #### **Description**
Build identity systems from core elements outward, ensuring cohesion across all touchpoints
  #### **When**
Starting a new brand identity or rebrand project
  #### **Example**
    1. Define brand essence (values, personality, positioning)
    2. Create logo system (primary mark, variations, lockups)
    3. Establish color system (primary, secondary, functional, tints)
    4. Define typography hierarchy (headings, body, mono, display)
    5. Set spacing/grid system (consistent rhythm)
    6. Create component library (buttons, cards, patterns)
    7. Document all decisions in living guidelines

  #### **Name**
Smallest-First Logo Design
  #### **Description**
Design logos for the smallest application first to ensure scalability and recognition
  #### **When**
Creating a new logo or symbol that needs to work across all sizes
  #### **Example**
    Test your logo at:
    - 16x16px (favicon)
    - 32x32px (app icon)
    - 44x44px (mobile touch target)
    
    If it's not recognizable at 16px, simplify. Remove detail until it holds.
    Then scale up to billboard size to verify it still has presence.

  #### **Name**
Color System Hierarchy
  #### **Description**
Structure color palettes with clear purpose and relationships between tones
  #### **When**
Defining a brand color system that needs to scale across products
  #### **Example**
    Primary (brand recognition):
      - Base: #0066FF
      - Light: #4D94FF (backgrounds, hover states)
      - Dark: #0052CC (pressed states, emphasis)
    
    Secondary (supporting):
      - Accent: #FF6B35 (CTAs, highlights)
    
    Functional (system):
      - Success: #00C48C
      - Warning: #FFB020
      - Error: #FF4444
      - Info: #0EA5E9
    
    Each with 3-5 tints for UI flexibility

  #### **Name**
Progressive Brand Disclosure
  #### **Description**
Layer brand expression—start with recognition, add personality only where it enhances
  #### **When**
Applying brand across diverse touchpoints with varying attention levels
  #### **Example**
    High-attention contexts (marketing site, packaging):
    - Full brand expression, personality, storytelling
    
    Medium-attention contexts (product UI, emails):
    - Core brand elements (logo, colors, typography)
    - Restrained personality
    
    Low-attention contexts (receipts, loading states):
    - Minimal brand (wordmark or icon only)
    - Maximum clarity and function

  #### **Name**
Guideline Enablement Over Policing
  #### **Description**
Write brand guidelines that empower teams to make good decisions, not just rules to follow
  #### **When**
Creating brand guidelines for distributed teams
  #### **Example**
    Instead of:
    "Never place the logo smaller than 40px"
    
    Write:
    "Logo minimum size: 40px for digital, 10mm for print
    WHY: Below this size, detail becomes illegible
    WHEN TO BREAK: Favicon/app icon contexts—use icon-only variant"
    
    Include decision trees: "If X context, then Y variant"

  #### **Name**
Multi-Context Name Testing
  #### **Description**
Validate brand names across linguistic, cultural, and practical contexts before commitment
  #### **When**
Finalizing a brand name or product name
  #### **Example**
    Test checklist:
    ✓ Domain available (.com + relevant TLDs)
    ✓ Social handles available (@name on major platforms)
    ✓ Trademark search (USPTO, international if relevant)
    ✓ Pronunciation test (say it out loud to 10 people)
    ✓ Spelling test (can people spell it after hearing it?)
    ✓ Translation check (no offensive meanings in target markets)
    ✓ Google search (existing associations, competing brands)
    ✓ Verbal identity (tagline, descriptor, voice preview)
    

## Anti-Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Logo-First Branding
  #### **Description**
Starting with logo design before understanding brand strategy and positioning
  #### **Why**
Logo is a symbol of the brand, not the brand itself. Without strategy, you're designing decoration.
  #### **Instead**
    1. First: Define brand strategy (audience, positioning, values, personality)
    2. Then: Explore visual directions informed by strategy
    3. Finally: Design logo that expresses the brand truth
    
    The logo should be inevitable given the strategy, not arbitrary.

  #### **Name**
Trend-Chasing Identity
  #### **Description**
Building brand identity around current design trends rather than timeless principles
  #### **Why**
Trends date quickly. Your rebrand feels outdated in 2 years. Simple, distinctive marks last decades.
  #### **Instead**
    Ask: "Will this still feel right in 10 years?"
    
    Trend indicators to avoid:
    - Gradient logos (unless core to brand story)
    - Overly geometric "tech" styling
    - Whatever Dribbble is doing this month
    
    Instead: Simple shapes, limited colors, clear hierarchy
    

---
  #### **Name**
Overly Complex Logo Systems
  #### **Description**
Creating too many logo variations, lockups, and special cases
  #### **Why**
Complexity leads to inconsistent application. People will misuse variants or create their own.
  #### **Instead**
    Essential system:
    - Primary horizontal lockup
    - Primary stacked lockup
    - Icon/symbol only (for small applications)
    - One-color version (black, white)
    
    That's it. If you need more, your primary mark isn't working.
    

---
  #### **Name**
Unenforced Guidelines
  #### **Description**
Creating comprehensive brand guidelines that no one follows or can find
  #### **Why**
Guidelines on a PDF no one reads might as well not exist. Brand becomes inconsistent.
  #### **Instead**
    Make guidelines actionable:
    - Design system in Figma (actual components to copy)
    - Public brand site with downloadable assets
    - Slack/email support for brand questions
    - Regular audits of brand applications
    - Template library for common needs
    
    If it's hard to do it right, people will do it wrong.

  #### **Name**
Descriptive Naming
  #### **Description**
Choosing literal, descriptive names that explain what you do rather than creating brand equity
  #### **Why**
Descriptive names are forgettable, hard to trademark, and competitors can copy the category.
  #### **Instead**
    Bad: "FastShip Logistics Platform"
    Better: "ShipHawk" (evocative, protectable, memorable)
    
    Bad: "Premium Cloud Storage Solutions"
    Better: "Dropbox" (simple, metaphorical, unique)
    
    Invented or suggestive names build equity. Descriptive names build nothing.

  #### **Name**
Design-by-Committee
  #### **Description**
Making brand decisions through group consensus and stakeholder voting
  #### **Why**
Strong brands have a point of view. Committee design is bland, safe, and forgettable.
  #### **Instead**
    Process:
    1. Gather input from stakeholders (goals, concerns, preferences)
    2. Designer synthesizes into 2-3 distinct directions
    3. Present with rationale tied to strategy
    4. Decision-maker (CEO/founder) chooses direction
    5. Refine chosen direction (not Frankenstein all three)
    
    Collaboration in research and refinement. Vision from decision-maker.
