## Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
The Pirate Metrics Framework (AARRR)
  #### **Description**
Track customer journey through five stages to identify bottlenecks
  #### **When**
Setting up measurement for a growth-stage product
  #### **Example**
    Acquisition: How do people find you? (traffic sources, CAC by channel)
    Activation: Do they have a good first experience? (signup → value)
    Retention: Do they come back? (DAU/MAU, churn rate)
    Referral: Do they tell others? (k-factor, viral coefficient)
    Revenue: Are they paying? (conversion rate, LTV)
    
    Optimize one stage at a time. Fix activation before scaling acquisition.

  #### **Name**
Channel Sequencing Strategy
  #### **Description**
Layer marketing channels in order of validation and scalability
  #### **When**
Planning go-to-market for a new product or market
  #### **Example**
    Phase 1 (0-100 customers): Manual outreach, product hunt, communities
    → Validate messaging, learn customer language
    
    Phase 2 (100-1000 customers): Content marketing, SEO, partnerships
    → Build compound growth assets
    
    Phase 3 (1000+ customers): Paid acquisition, retargeting, PR
    → Scale proven channels with predictable CAC
    
    Don't skip to Phase 3. Foundations compound.

  #### **Name**
The 40/40/20 Rule
  #### **Description**
Allocation framework for campaign success factors
  #### **When**
Planning campaign strategy and resource allocation
  #### **Example**
    40% - Audience targeting (right people)
    40% - Offer/message (right value prop)
    20% - Creative execution (how it looks)
    
    Most marketers over-invest in creative, under-invest in targeting.
    Great creative to wrong audience = wasted budget.

  #### **Name**
Attribution Multi-Touch Modeling
  #### **Description**
Give credit across the customer journey, not just last-click
  #### **When**
Understanding which channels drive real business value
  #### **Example**
    Customer journey:
    1. Found via Google (organic) → reads blog post
    2. Saw retargeting ad (paid) → visited pricing
    3. Got email (email) → signed up for trial
    4. Clicked LinkedIn ad (paid) → converted
    
    Last-click: LinkedIn ad gets 100% credit
    Multi-touch: Google 25%, Retargeting 25%, Email 25%, LinkedIn 25%
    
    Reality: All touchpoints mattered. Don't kill channels based on last-click.

  #### **Name**
Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL) Scoring
  #### **Description**
Prioritize leads based on fit and engagement signals
  #### **When**
Scaling lead generation beyond what sales can manually review
  #### **Example**
    Demographic fit (max 50 points):
    - Company size matches ICP: +20
    - Job title decision-maker: +20
    - Industry match: +10
    
    Behavioral signals (max 50 points):
    - Viewed pricing page: +20
    - Downloaded case study: +15
    - Attended webinar: +15
    
    MQL threshold: 60+ points → auto-route to sales

  #### **Name**
Campaign Retrospective Format
  #### **Description**
Structured post-campaign analysis to extract learnings
  #### **When**
After every significant campaign to build institutional knowledge
  #### **Example**
    What was the goal? (awareness, leads, revenue)
    What did we do? (channels, creative, budget)
    What happened? (results vs. goals, data)
    What worked? (unexpected wins)
    What didn't? (failures, waste)
    What do we do next time? (actionable changes)
    
    Document in shared wiki. Reference before planning next campaign.
    

## Anti-Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Vanity Metrics Obsession
  #### **Description**
Optimizing for impressive-sounding metrics that don't drive business outcomes
  #### **Why**
Traffic, followers, impressions don't pay the bills; revenue does
  #### **Instead**
Track metrics that tie to revenue. Qualified leads, trials, paying customers, LTV.

---
  #### **Name**
Set and Forget Campaigns
  #### **Description**
Launching campaigns without ongoing monitoring and optimization
  #### **Why**
Markets shift, creative fatigues, and you waste budget on declining performance
  #### **Instead**
Review performance weekly. Pause underperformers. Scale winners. Test constantly.

---
  #### **Name**
Blaming Sales for Bad Leads
  #### **Description**
Generating high volume of low-quality leads then blaming sales for not converting
  #### **Why**
Marketing and sales should collaborate on lead definition and qualification
  #### **Instead**
Agree on MQL criteria together. Track lead quality and conversion rates by source.

---
  #### **Name**
Copy-Paste Competitor Strategy
  #### **Description**
Replicating competitor tactics without understanding their context
  #### **Why**
What works for a brand with 10x budget and recognition won't work for you
  #### **Instead**
Learn from competitors but adapt to your unique position, budget, and audience.

---
  #### **Name**
Channel Hopping Without Validation
  #### **Description**
Jumping to new channels before mastering current ones
  #### **Why**
Shallow presence everywhere beats deep presence nowhere. Channels need time to work.
  #### **Instead**
Give each channel 3-6 months of serious effort. Master one before adding next.

---
  #### **Name**
Marketing in a Silo
  #### **Description**
Running marketing without input from sales, product, and customer success
  #### **Why**
Best marketing comes from customer insights; those live across the organization
  #### **Instead**
Regular syncs with sales (lead quality), product (roadmap), CS (churn reasons).
