  #### **Name**
Broadcast-Only Social
  #### **Description**
Using social to broadcast, not engage
  #### **Why Bad**
    No community forms from one-way content.
    Followers don't become members.
    Algorithm penalizes low engagement.
    
  #### **What To Do Instead**
    80% engagement, 20% broadcast.
    Reply, quote, comment.
    Build relationships, not just reach.

  #### **Name**
Platform Mismatch
  #### **Description**
Same content across all platforms
  #### **Why Bad**
    Each platform has different culture.
    Content that works on Twitter fails on Reddit.
    Feels inauthentic.
    
  #### **What To Do Instead**
    Adapt to platform culture.
    Different content types per platform.
    Native feel on each.
